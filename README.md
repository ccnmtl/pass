Pass
==========

PASS is a five-year project to build a website with tools to educate pre-doctoral dental students about patient populations and how demographics play into decision of building a successful dental practice. The project features a website with educational videos, interactive maps, and information on specific populations to be used in teaching second-year students at Columbia University College of Dental Medicine as part of the course "Oral Health Care Delivery." Each year of the project will focus on a specific population; the focus of the first year is young children in the United States.

This Django project was deprecated July 2017, and is not actively maintained.

A sustainable, static site was developed in Hugo to house the content and activities. Visit the new Pass at <a href="http://pass.ctl.columbia.edu">pass.ctl.columbia.edu</a>.
